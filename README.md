My first portfolio project: Powerplants asset management system

Single page application for the primary AMS services. This is running with react and reactn (will be converting this GraphQL and Apollo to make things more efficient). 

TODOS:
1. Testing with Jest and Enzyme (mocked provider with Apollo)
2. Conversion to Apollo/GraphQL
3. This will be launched into google kubernetes cluster with istio and ingress.
4. Rolling deployment with github actions

[Work to be added here soon](http://iamleonid.me/)
